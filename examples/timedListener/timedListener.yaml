# timeToListen specifies how long to have the webhook registration alive

#   Server Related Configuration
########################################
server:
  # address provides the port number for the endpoint to bind to.
  # ":443" is ideal, but may require some special handling due to it being
  # a reserved (by the kernel) port.
  address: ":7100"

########################################
#   Authorization Related Configuration
########################################

# secret contains information for finding the secret on incoming requests.  If
# both header and webhook secret are empty, no authentication is done on
# incoming requests to timedListener.  Otherwise, the value at the header provided
# should hold a sha1 hash of the request body.  It should be in the format:
#
# sha1<delimiter><hash>
#
# (Optional)
secret:
  # header provides the header key where the hash is expected.
  # (Optional)
  header: "X-Webpa-Signature"

  # delimiter provides the string that is expected between "sha1" and the hash.
  # (Optional)
  delimiter: "="

########################################
#   Webhook Registration Related Configuration
########################################

# webhook provides the information needed to register to a webhook.  If the
# urls and event regex aren't empty and the interval is greater than 0,
# registration occurs.
# (Optional)
webhook:
  # registrationInterval provides the time to wait between each registration to
  # the webhook.  If this is set to 0, no registration is done.
  # (Optional)
  registrationInterval: "55s"

  # timeout provides the length of time the request should wait before timing
  # out.
  timeout: "10s"

  # registrationURL provides the place to register the webhook.
  registrationURL: "http://tr1d1um:6100/api/v3/hook"

  # request provides the information passed in the webhook registration request.
  request:
    # config provides configuration values for the requests to the webhook
    # receiver.
    config:
      # url provides the server the webhook should send the events to.  If this
      # value isn't set, no registration happens.
      url: "http://listener-example:7100/api/v1/events"

      # contentType provides the content type timedListener expects from the requests
      # it receives.
      # (Optional) defaults to "wrp"
      #contentType: "wrp"

      # secret provides the key for hashing the messages the webhook sends.
      # If this is empty, no authentication is done later for incoming requests
      # to timedListener.
      # (Optional)
      secret: "super secret"

      # maxRetryCount is the number of times to retry on a failure.
      # (Optional)
      maxRetryCount: 3

      # alternativeURLs provides endpoints to round robin through on a failure
      # to send an event.  This is only used if the maxRetryCount is greater
      # than 0.
      # (Optional)
      #AlternativeURLs: []

    # events provides a list of regular expressions that tells the webhook
    # which endpoints to send to timedListener.  If the destination of an event
    # matches a regular expression in this list, it is sent to timedListener
    events: [".*"]

    # matcher provides regular expressions to match against the event source.
    # (Optional) default is [".*"]
    # matcher:
    #   deviceID: [".*"]

    # duration is how long for the webhook to live for.
    duration: "1m"

  # the below configuration values provide a way to add an Authorization header
  # to the request to the webhook.  If both basic and sat contain empty values,
  # no header is sent.  sat takes priority over basic if both are set.

  # basic provides a way to use Basic Authorization when registering to a
  # webhook.  If this value is provided and sat isn't, the following header is
  # added to the registration request:
  #
  # Authorization Basic {basic}
  #
  # (Optional)
  basic: "dXNlcjpwYXNz"

  # jwt provides a way to use Bearer Authorization when registering to a
  # webhook.  If the below values are all provided, a request is made to the
  # URL to get the token to be used in the registration request.  The
  # header would look like:
  #
  # Authorization Bearer {token}
  #
  # (Optional)
  jwt:
    # requestHeaders are added to the request for the token.
    # (Optional)
    # requestHeaders:
    #   "": ""

    # authURL is the URL to access for the token.
    authURL: ""

    # timeout is how long the request to get the token will take before
    # timing out.
    timeout: "1m"

    # buffer is the length of time before a token expires to get a new token.
    # (Optional)
    buffer: "5s"
