## Summary

Wrp-listener provides packages to help a consumer register to a webhook and 
authenticate messages received.  Registering to a webhook can be done directly 
or set up to run at an interval.  Message authentication is set up to work with 
the [bascule](https://github.com/xmidt-org/bascule) library.

## Details

### Authentication

Authentication is done using the bascule library: the token factory provided 
in the `hashTokenFactory` package can be given to the bascule Constructor 
middleware in order to verify that the hashed body given with a request is 
valid and created with the expected secret.

### Registering

Registration happens through the `webhookClient` package, and can be set up for 
manual registration or registration at an interval.  If the consumer of this 
package decides when to register, an error is returned if registering a webhook 
is not successful.  With registering at an interval, a logger can be provided.  
Then, if an error occurs, the registerer will log it and then try again at the 
next interval.
